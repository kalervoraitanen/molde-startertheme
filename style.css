------------------------------------------------------------------

Molde uses Sass by default. If you prefer using regular CSS,
then feel free to modify this theme how you like.

Use compiler tools like Grunt to compile Sass into valid minified CSS.
The Sass file to compile is found in source/scss/style.scss
and set the output to assets/css/style.min.css

Javascript file is found in source/js/scripts.js and you should
minify it to assets/js/scripts.min.js
You can change the used filenames and folders in functions.php file.
