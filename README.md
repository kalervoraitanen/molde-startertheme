# Molde
A lightweight WordPress Development Theme

Molde is designed to give a strong semantic and lightweight foundation to a theme.
It is highly SEO optimized and has only minimal amount of CSS (only some basic defaults).
It is meant to be used as a starter theme which you can use to develop your own theme.

With a Mobile-First approach Molde serves up only the minimum to small devices and progressively enhances for larger viewports.

Molde is translation ready and comes with Finnish translation out of the box.

And what's best it is totally free. You can do what every you want with it.
